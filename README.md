Better-Beds
===========

Minecraft mod to improve beds over vanilla experience.

### Compiling Better Beds
1. Ensure that `Java` (found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)), `Git` (found [here](http://git-scm.com/download/)) are installed correctly on your system.
1. Navigate to a directory in a shell where you want the project located and run `git clone` with the repository url. This will create a `Better-Beds/` directory at that location.
1. Navigate to `Better-Beds/` in a shell and run:
 * `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` to setup a complete developement environment.
 * If using eclipse run `gradlew eclipse` to setup a workspace.
 * If using intellij idea run `gradlew idea` to setup a workspace.
 * On Windows: use `gradlew.bat` instead of `gradlew`.
